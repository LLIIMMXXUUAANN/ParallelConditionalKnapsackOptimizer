The problem entails developing a parallel program capable of automatically identifying the most valuable combination of items for transportation from a dynamic warehouse. The program must ensure that the total weight of the selected items remains within the container's capacity. The priority is to guarantee accurate output within the time limit, using parallel computing such as multithreading or multiprocessing, for improved performance, with correctness as the focus over speed. The warehouse inventory comprises a variable number of items, each with its weight and value, and the program needs to compute the optimal selection within a prescribed time limit of 300 seconds. However, KNSK.exe will terminate the program if it exceeds 180 seconds.

Bonus: The problem may include rules specifying that certain items can be combined to enhance their value. For example, if items A and B can be combined, the rule "AB 1 34" indicates that combining A and B increases the weight by one and the value by 34. However, it's up to the program to decide whether to utilize these rules. In the output file, items can be kept separate by listing them individually, or combined items can be represented by their combined name, following the format specified in the problem file. For instance, "AB" represents the combination of items A and B, while "BA" would result in errors. The output format must precisely match the specified naming convention.
